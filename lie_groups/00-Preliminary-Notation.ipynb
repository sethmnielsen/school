    "A group is a set, $G$, together with an operation $\\cdot$ (called the group law of $G$) that combines any two elements $a\\in G$ and $b\\in G$ to form another element in $G$, denoted $a\\cdot b$ or $ab$. To qualify as a group, the set and operation, $(G, \\cdot)$, must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Closure:\n",
    "For all $a, b\\in G$, the result of the operation, $a\\cdot b$, is also in $G$.\n",
    "2.  Associativity:\n",
    "For all $a, b, c \\in G$, $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$.\n",
    "3.  Identity element:\n",
    "There exists a unique element $e\\in G$, called the identity element, such that for every element $a \\in G$, the equation $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$ holds. \n",

    "Note in particular, that groups do not have any notion of linearity.  For example, there is no notion of scalar multiplication, or that if $a, b\\in G$, that $\\alpha a + \\beta b \\in G$.  Scalar multiplication and vector addition are notions that are associated with a vector space.  \n"

    "### Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms\n",

    "after or before applying the map $a$. This requirement ensures that $a(1_G) = 1_H$, and also $a(g)^{−1} = a(g^{−1})$ for all $g\\in G$. Thus a group homomorphism respects all the structure of $G$ provided by the group axioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two groups $G$ and $H$ are called isomorphic if there exist group homomorphisms $a: G \\rightarrow H$ and $b: H \\rightarrow G$, such that applying the two functions one after another in each of the two possible orders gives the identity functions of $G$ and $H$. That is, $a(b(h)) = h$ and $b(a(g)) = g$ for any $g\\in G$ and $h\\in H$. From an abstract point of view, isomorphic groups carry the same information. For example, proving that $g \\cdot g = 1_G$ for some element $g$ of $G$ is equivalent to proving that $a(g) ∗ a(g) = 1_H$, because applying $a$ to the first equality yields the second, and applying $b$ to the second gives back the first.\n",
